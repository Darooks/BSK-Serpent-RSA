As a child, you would wait, and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one 
That work while they all play.

In youth, you'd lay, awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change 
But it was just a dream.

Chorus:
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust.

The time will come when you will have to rise
Above the best improve yourself 
Your spirit never dies.

Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne above
Don't weep for me, cause 
This will be the labor of my love.

Chorus:
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust.

Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the Warriors that built this town from dust
